# Class Timer

> The trouble is, you think you have time.

## Description
For teachers, time management is important. It seems straightforward, but it becomes difficult during a lesson when you have million other things to keep track of. Class timer takes away a little brain work from time tracking, allowing you to use the brain space for other things, like making sure Jill does not flick snot on James. 

## Problem
There are two problems that manual time tracking can cause:
1. Stop you from doing other things. Manuel time tracking can divert your attention and mental resources away from other tasks, such as class content delivery, student engagement, and behaviour management,
2. Poor time management. You might accidentally let a activity overrun or run out of time. 

## Approach
This application helps you track time during the class. 

The application can be accessed here:

### Basic Workflow
1. Set up classes on the Classes page, inputting class names and start and end times.
2. Before or during a class, select the appropriate class on the Classes page.
3. During the class, dynamically choose quick timers from the Timers page to start immediately.

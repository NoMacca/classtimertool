## Description
For teachers, time management is important. It is straightforward enough but it can become difficult during a lesson when you have a million other things to keep track of. This simple tool helps you save brainpower, so you can focus on other important things, like making sure Jill does not flick snot on James.

## Problem
There are two problems that manual time tracking can cause
1. Stopping you from doing other things. Manual time tracking can divert your attention and mental energy away from other tasks, such as class content delivery, student engagement, and behaviour management.
2. Time management slips. You might accidentally let an activity overrun or run out of time for an important activity. 

## Approach
This application helps you track time during the class. 

The application can be accessed here:

### Basic Workflow
1. Add your classes on the Classes page.
2. Before the lesson start, select your next class on the Classes page.
3. During the class, dynamically choose quick timers or add custom timers. 
4. Use the brain break timer to check how long it has been since the last one.
